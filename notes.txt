=============================================== TODO ==============================================

@@@@@@@@              BUGS

Fix capitalization on item descriptions (figure out what it should be)

@@@@@@@@              TO WORK ON NEXT

place type MINE
    -- consume illumination while exploring
    -- find gems, ore, coal inside
    -- handle interaction if occupied
        - talk with foreman
        - ask for information
        - recruit
        - attack
            miners run into the mine
    -- if occupied, might be a few ingots lying around
    -- convert to encounter if unoccupied, and it turns out that monsters are inside
    -- skills to identify gemstone matricies, metal ores
    -- a way to keep track of mines that have already been cleared, and when cleared
        -- monsters could have moved in after a while
    -- a way to update the mine type on the CHOOSE DESTINATION button readout
    -- a mine icon
    -- add smelting skill
        -- use to identify type of mine
        -- quality of ore determines chance of success
    -- add diplomacy skill
    -- add gemology skill
        -- use to identify type of mine
    -- trainer for smelting

@@@@@@@@              BASIC FUNCTIONALITY

Add a user-defined marker on the map
    Tie it to the current area, and keep a list of markers on the Journal page

Allow interruption of movement, due to events

Code up these place types:
    ENCOUNTER
    DAMSEL_IN_DISTRESS
    MERCHANT
    SKYSHIP
    TRAP
    TREEHOUSE
    COTTAGE
    FARM
    VILLAGE
    FORTRESS
    CASTLE
    SHIP
    TOWER
    PYRAMID
    FAIRY_RING
    STONE_RUINS
    WOODEN_RUINS
    QUICKSAND
    PIT
    CAVE
    MINE

@@@@@@@@              IMPROVEMENTS

The journal needs a bunch of events stuff added to it

For each step actually moved, show any cool messages available (scaled cliffs, crossed water, etc)

have stashes get found and looted over time
    need a stashing skill (concealment?)

add features to minimap
    show/hide icons
    show map/terrain types

add reputation

equipment should wear out
    repairs should fix it back to "used"

sleep dialog doesn't need radio buttons, or an OK button. One click should choose the sleep.

show current-ability-score/base-ability-score in crew listing

all bodies weigh the same, it should be a bit random

@@@@@@@@              TECHNICAL

replace ugly in-javascript html with handlebar templates

enable or disable debug mode via query parameter (this will control if the tests get run or not)

@@@@@@@@              STORY

Make searching the very first area result in finding another crewmember, injured, who will join you (and a bunch of gear)

Add blacksmith shops to villages and other populated area, so that the player can smelt their ore into ingots.

@@@@@@@@              TUNING

buffalo and some large animals should be more rare, impossible to catch without a weapon
    --- use c.chooseWeightedOption

@@@@@@@@              CORE

check all the code for TODOs

come up with list of random NPC names
    lists of male, female, and last names
    maintain list of previously-seen names in gx.gs, to avoid dupes

sort inventory lists

@@@@@@@@              FEATURES

make the journal fancier - allow paging by day

figure out how to save and load games, server-side
    stuff player variables into array, save as JSON
    Make usernames, passwords
    save old versions in other directory, with entire app and all save data

@@@@@@@@              DEPTH

Make random player stats always add up to 5. (later: make them user-specifiable)

Add sickness and disease

@@@@@@@@              COSMETIC

Convert icons to chicklet buttons (or small torn pieces of paper)

add a lot more descriptions to World

add a bunch more gear

scan in drawings

show stats as progress bars



================================================ notes ==============================================

// ideas from Thomas on how to improve the loading
require(['my-app'], function(app) {

    // one option
    app.on("load", app.start);

    // another option
    app.load().then(function(loadedApp) {
        loadedApp.start();
    })

});
